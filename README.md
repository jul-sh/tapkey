# Passkeys that turn into real keys.

tapkey is a smol CLI that lets you recover the same SSH key, `age` identity, or app secret on any machine where you can unlock the same passkey.

Passkey providers sync passkeys. They usually do not sync arbitrary private keys such as SSH keys. tapkey bridges that gap by deriving the key locally after passkey authentication, without manually copying private key files between machines.

## Install

```bash
URL=$(curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/jul-sh/tapkey/releases/latest \
  | grep -o '"browser_download_url": *"[^"]*"' | cut -d '"' -f 4 \
  | grep "$([ "$(uname -s)" = Darwin ] && echo arm64 || echo linux)") \
  && curl -fLO "$URL" && mkdir -p ~/.local/bin \
  && if [ "$(uname -s)" = Darwin ]; then
       mkdir -p ~/.local/share/tapkey && unzip -o tapkey-*-arm64.zip -d ~/.local/share/tapkey \
       && ln -sf ~/.local/share/tapkey/Tapkey.app/Contents/MacOS/tapkey ~/.local/bin/tapkey
     else
       unzip -o tapkey-*-linux*.zip tapkey -d ~/.local/bin
     fi
```

Releases are built in CI with [build attestation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/using-artifact-attestations). To verify the binary was built from this repo's source (requires [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)):

```bash
gh attestation verify tapkey-*.zip -R jul-sh/tapkey
```

## Usage

Create the passkey once:

```bash
tapkey --init
```

Then derive key material:

```bash
tapkey [name]
```

Use a name to derive different keys from the same passkey:

```bash
tapkey backup
tapkey deploy
tapkey # The default name is `default`.
```

Derive key material in different formats:

```bash
tapkey myBase64Key --format base64
tapkey myRawKey --format raw
tapkey smolSecrets --format age
tapkey smolSshKey --format ssh
```

Get the public key for a derived key, e.g. a key named `smolSshKey`:

```bash
tapkey public-key smolSshKey --format ssh
```

### Encrypt and decrypt files

Encrypt a file with your derived age identity:

```bash
tapkey --encrypt secrets.env
```

This writes `secrets.env.age`, encrypted to your passkey. Decrypt it:

```bash
tapkey --decrypt secrets.env.age > secrets.env
```

Encrypt to yourself and others:

```bash
tapkey --encrypt secrets.env --to age1abc...
```

Or use a recipients file (one age public key per line):

```bash
tapkey --encrypt secrets.env -R age-recipients.txt
```

Encrypt to others only, without including yourself:

```bash
tapkey --encrypt secrets.env --to age1abc... --no-self
```

The key name works the same way as with key derivation:

```bash
tapkey backup --encrypt secrets.env
tapkey backup --decrypt secrets.env.age > secrets.env
```

## Requirements

### macOS (native passkey)
- macOS 15.0 or later
- Apple Silicon (`arm64`)
- A passkey provider with PRF support (like Apple's built-in Password Manager)

### Linux / other platforms (auth via phone)
- A phone with a passkey provider that supports the PRF extension

## How It Works

1. `tapkey --init` creates a passkey for the relying party `tapkey.jul.sh`. The passkey lives in your chosen passkey provider.
2. `tapkey [name]` performs a WebAuthn assertion using the PRF extension. The PRF input is `SHA256("tapkey:prf:<name>")`, so each name requests a different PRF output directly from the passkey.
3. The PRF output is expanded with HKDF-SHA256 using a fixed tapkey info string to produce 32 bytes of key material.
4. The result is formatted as raw bytes, hex, base64, an `age` secret key, or an OpenSSH Ed25519 key. With `--encrypt`/`--decrypt`, the derived age identity is used to encrypt or decrypt files directly.

Same passkey, same name, same derived key. Different names derive different keys.

### Platforms

On macOS passkey support is native, authentication is as simple as touching Touch ID. 

On systems without native passkey support (like Linux), tapkey authenticates via your phone over an encrypted relay. It prints a QR code to stderr, you scan it on your phone, approve with your passkey, and the result is sent back over an end-to-end encrypted channel (X25519 + AES-256-GCM). The relay never sees plaintext key material.

## Security

tapkey's security model is simple: the passkey is the root secret.

- tapkey depends on your passkey provider, WebAuthn PRF, and local device authentication. It does not create a stronger trust boundary than the provider already gives you.
- tapkey does not sync or cache derived keys itself. It derives on demand, writes to stdout, and exits. There are no local config files or cached state.
- If you save the output, pipe it into another tool, or import it into an agent, that destination now holds the key and must be trusted accordingly.
- The PRF inputs are public and derived from the key name. They provide stable derivation and domain separation, not secrecy.
- Replacing the registered passkey changes every key derived from it. Treat the passkey as the root of your derived identities.

### Auth via phone over relay (non-macOS)

When tapkey authenticates via your phone, additional trust considerations apply:

- **You trust the web page served to your phone.** The website served by `tapkey.jul.sh` performs the WebAuthn ceremony, receives the PRF output, encrypts it, and posts back to the host, via the relay. You trust its functionality and integrity. The web page is served inspectable, but in practice you are unlikely to review it each time.
- The Cloudflare relay (`tapkey-relay.julsh.workers.dev`) forwards opaque encrypted blobs. It never sees plaintext key material. The channel is end-to-end encrypted with X25519 ECDH + HKDF-SHA256 + AES-256-GCM. An attacker who controls the relay can deny service but cannot decrypt the payload.
- On macOS hosts, none of this applies. The native passkey flow uses the hosts passkeys, or alternatively a native QR code with that opens a native direct device-to-device channel.

## Tips

### Nix flake

Add tapkey to a Nix shell using the attested, signed release:

```nix
{
  inputs.tapkey.url = "github:jul-sh/tapkey";

  outputs = { tapkey, ... }: {
    # add tapkey.packages.${system}.default to your buildInputs
  };
}
```

### Storing a derived key in macOS Keychain

If you want to avoid re-authenticating every time, you can store a derived key in the macOS Keychain:

```bash
security add-generic-password -s tapkey -a AGE_SECRET_KEY -w "$(tapkey myKey --format age)"
```

### Usage with age CLI

tapkey has built-in encryption via `--encrypt` and `--decrypt`, but you can also use the `age` CLI directly with derived keys:

```bash
echo "secret" | age -r "$(tapkey public-key smolSecrets)" > secret.age
age -d -i <(tapkey smolSecrets --format age) secret.age
```
