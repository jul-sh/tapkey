# tapkey

Derive deterministic symmetric keys from a passkey via the WebAuthn PRF extension.

Same passkey on any device — same key. Works with any passkey provider that supports PRF (iCloud Keychain, 1Password, etc.). No server, no secrets to copy between machines.

## Install

### From release (recommended)

Download the latest release:

```bash
gh release download --repo jul-sh/tapkey --pattern 'tapkey-*.zip'
unzip tapkey-*.zip
# Remove macOS quarantine (the binary is attested but not Apple-notarized)
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine Tapkey.app
# Symlink into PATH
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -sf "$(pwd)/Tapkey.app/Contents/MacOS/tapkey" ~/.local/bin/tapkey
```

#### Verify build attestation

Compute the artifact digest and verify it against Sigstore's transparency log:

```bash
sha256sum tapkey-*.zip
gh attestation download tapkey-*.zip -R jul-sh/tapkey
cosign verify-blob-attestation \
  --bundle <sha256:HASH>.jsonl \
  --new-bundle-format \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  --certificate-identity-regexp="^https://github.com/jul-sh/tapkey/.github/workflows/release.yml" \
  tapkey-*.zip
```

This verifies that the binary was built by the expected GitHub Actions workflow, the signature is valid in Sigstore's transparency log (Rekor), and the artifact digest matches.

### From source

Requires macOS 15+, Xcode Command Line Tools, and a [paid Apple Developer Program membership](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) (Associated Domains entitlement requires it).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jul-sh/tapkey.git
cd tapkey
make install
```

This compiles, codesigns with entitlements, and symlinks to `~/.local/bin/tapkey`.

## Usage

### First-time setup

Create a passkey (one-time — macOS will let you choose your passkey provider):

```bash
tapkey register
```

### Derive a key

```bash
tapkey derive                              # 32-byte key as hex (default)
tapkey derive --format base64              # base64
tapkey derive --format raw                 # raw bytes to stdout
tapkey derive --format age                 # AGE-SECRET-KEY-1...
tapkey derive --format ssh                 # OpenSSH Ed25519 private key
```

### Named keys

Use `--name` to derive different keys from the same passkey. Each name deterministically produces a different key:

```bash
tapkey derive --name backup                # one key for backups
tapkey derive --name deploy                # a different key for deploys
tapkey derive --name age --format age      # age encryption key
tapkey derive --name ssh --format ssh      # SSH key
```

The default name is `"default"`.

### Public keys

```bash
tapkey public-key                          # age public key (age1...)
tapkey public-key --name ssh --format ssh  # ssh-ed25519 AAAA...
```

### Use with age

```bash
# Encrypt
echo "secret" | age -r $(tapkey public-key --name age) > secret.age

# Decrypt
age -d -i <(tapkey derive --name age --format age) secret.age
```

### Use with SSH

```bash
# Write SSH key
tapkey derive --name ssh --format ssh > ~/.ssh/id_tapkey
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_tapkey

# Get public key for authorized_keys / GitHub
tapkey public-key --name ssh --format ssh
```

## How it works

1. **Register** creates a passkey via `ASAuthorizationPlatformPublicKeyCredentialProvider` with the relying party `tapkey.jul.sh`. The passkey is stored in your chosen passkey provider (iCloud Keychain, 1Password, etc.) and syncs across devices.

2. **Derive** performs a WebAuthn assertion with the [PRF extension](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#prf-extension) (macOS 15+). The PRF extension takes a fixed salt and returns a deterministic 32-byte `SymmetricKey` bound to the passkey credential.

3. The PRF output is passed through **HKDF-SHA256** with info string `"tapkey:<name>"` to derive 32 bytes of key material. Different `--name` values produce different keys from the same PRF output.

4. The derived bytes are formatted as hex, base64, an age secret key (Bech32), an OpenSSH Ed25519 key, or raw bytes.

### Why not use the Secure Enclave directly?

The Secure Enclave already participates — it handles the credential's private key operations and the PRF computation for platform authenticators on Apple Silicon. The PRF output (a `SymmetricKey`) is then returned to userspace, where HKDF derives the final key.

Further Secure Enclave integration isn't useful here: the Secure Enclave only stores P-256 asymmetric keys and can't perform HKDF or store arbitrary symmetric keys. Since tapkey's purpose is to output key material for use by other tools, the key must leave process memory regardless.

### Why can't I use an existing passkey?

tapkey requires `tapkey register` because:

- **PRF must be enabled at registration.** The PRF extension (CTAP2 `hmac-secret`) must be requested when the credential is created. Passkeys registered by typical website login flows don't request PRF, and it cannot be retroactively enabled.
- **Relying party binding.** Passkeys are bound to their relying party identifier (`tapkey.jul.sh`). A passkey created for a different domain cannot be used.

## Security model

### What's trusted

- **Your passkey provider** (iCloud Keychain, 1Password, etc.) — passkeys are synced via the provider's E2E encryption. For iCloud Keychain, the credential secret never leaves the Secure Enclave, and access is gated by biometric authentication.
- **The PRF extension** — deterministic output bound to the specific credential; different credentials produce different outputs even with the same salt.
- **HKDF-SHA256** — standard key derivation with domain separation via the `--name` parameter.
- **GitHub Actions build attestation** (if using a release binary) — Sigstore-signed SLSA provenance proves the binary was built by the expected workflow from this repository. Verify via cosign + Rekor (see [install](#verify-build-attestation)).

### What's public and safe to expose

- **PRF salt** (`SHA256("tapkey:prf-salt-v1")`) — fixed, deterministic, public. Knowing the salt doesn't help without the passkey.
- **Credential ID** (stored in `~/.config/tapkey/credential.json`) — identifies which passkey to use, not secret. It's equivalent to a username.
- **HKDF info strings** (`"tapkey:<name>"`) — public domain-separation labels.

### Domain separation

The `--name` flag sets the HKDF info string to `"tapkey:<name>"`. HKDF info is part of the expand step in the extract-then-expand construction, so different names produce cryptographically independent keys. The info string is used as raw bytes — there is no parsing, escaping, or normalization, so the mapping from name to key is injective. However, names that are prefixes of each other (e.g. `"a"` vs `"ab"`) are still fully independent because HKDF processes the entire info string as an opaque input to HMAC.

### Threat model

- **Attacker with physical access to unlocked Mac**: Can derive keys if they can authenticate with the passkey provider. tapkey is a convenience tool for key derivation, not a vault — it provides the same protection as your passkey provider's authentication (biometrics, device PIN, etc.).
- **Attacker with stolen provider credentials**: Would also need a trusted device to approve passkey sync. Your provider's recovery protections apply.
- **Attacker who compromises the binary**: Build attestation via Sigstore provides supply chain verification. Verify the artifact digest against the Rekor transparency log before trusting a release binary.

### What tapkey does NOT do

- Store or transmit derived keys — they're printed to stdout and forgotten
- Cache PRF output or derived keys
- Phone home or make network requests
- Run persistently — it launches, prompts for passkey authentication, outputs the key, and exits

## Requirements

- macOS 15.0 (Sequoia) or later
- Apple Silicon (arm64)
- A passkey provider with PRF support (iCloud Keychain, 1Password, etc.)
- Paid Apple Developer Program membership (for building from source — Associated Domains entitlement requires it)

```bash
# Enter dev shell (provides age, gh)
nix develop

# Build and sign
make

# Build, sign, and install

### Encrypting secrets for CI

echo "$AGE_SECRET_KEY" | age -d -i - secrets/SECRET_NAME.age
```
