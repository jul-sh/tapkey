# tapkey

tapkey is a tiny macOS app that lets you recover the same SSH key, `age` identity, or app secret on any Mac where you can unlock the same passkey.

Passkey providers sync passkeys. They usually do not sync arbitrary private keys such as SSH keys. tapkey bridges that gap by deriving the key locally after passkey authentication, without manually copying private key files between machines.

For example, iCloud Keychain can sync a passkey tied to your Apple account, but it will not sync an SSH private key. tapkey lets that synced passkey act as the root, so the SSH key can be re-derived locally on each Mac after authentication.

Under the hood, tapkey uses the WebAuthn PRF extension to derive a deterministic 32-byte secret from a passkey, then expands it with HKDF-SHA256. No server. No custom sync layer. The passkey provider handles sync; tapkey derives locally.

## Install

### From release

Download the latest release:

```bash
gh release download --repo jul-sh/tapkey --pattern 'tapkey-*.zip'
unzip tapkey-*.zip
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -sf "$(pwd)/Tapkey.app/Contents/MacOS/tapkey" ~/.local/bin/tapkey
```

Release artifacts are signed, notarized, and can be verified against GitHub Actions build attestation:

```bash
sha256sum tapkey-*.zip
gh attestation download tapkey-*.zip -R jul-sh/tapkey
cosign verify-blob-attestation \
  --bundle <sha256:HASH>.jsonl \
  --new-bundle-format \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  --certificate-identity-regexp="^https://github.com/jul-sh/tapkey/.github/workflows/release.yml" \
  tapkey-*.zip
```

### From source

Requires macOS 15+, Xcode Command Line Tools, and a [paid Apple Developer Program membership](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) for the Associated Domains entitlement. If you do not have one, use the release build instead; releases are already signed and notarized with my Apple Developer account.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jul-sh/tapkey.git
cd tapkey
make install
```

## Usage

Create a passkey once:

```bash
tapkey register
```

Derive key material:

```bash
tapkey derive
tapkey derive --format base64
tapkey derive --format raw
tapkey derive --format age
tapkey derive --format ssh
```

Use `--name` to derive different keys from the same passkey:

```bash
tapkey derive --name backup
tapkey derive --name deploy
tapkey derive --name age --format age
tapkey derive --name ssh --format ssh
```

The default name is `default`.

Get the public key for a derived key:

```bash
tapkey public-key
tapkey public-key --name ssh --format ssh
```

### age

```bash
echo "secret" | age -r "$(tapkey public-key --name age)" > secret.age
age -d -i <(tapkey derive --name age --format age) secret.age
```

### SSH

```bash
tapkey derive --name ssh --format ssh > ~/.ssh/id_tapkey
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_tapkey
tapkey public-key --name ssh --format ssh
```

## How It Works

1. `tapkey register` creates a passkey for the relying party `tapkey.jul.sh`. The passkey lives in your chosen passkey provider.
2. `tapkey derive` performs a WebAuthn assertion using the PRF extension and a fixed public salt.
3. The PRF output is expanded with HKDF-SHA256 using `tapkey:<name>` as the info string.
4. The result is formatted as raw bytes, hex, base64, an `age` secret key, or an OpenSSH Ed25519 key.

Same passkey, same name, same derived key. Different names derive different keys.

## Security

tapkey's security model is simple: the passkey is the root secret.

- tapkey depends on your passkey provider, WebAuthn PRF, and local device authentication. It does not create a stronger trust boundary than the provider already gives you.
- tapkey does not sync or cache derived keys itself. It derives on demand, writes to stdout, and exits.
- If you save the output, pipe it into another tool, or import it into an agent, that destination now holds the key and must be trusted accordingly.
- The local config file stores only the credential ID used to select the passkey. It is not secret key material.
- The PRF salt and key names are public. They provide stable derivation and domain separation, not secrecy.
- Replacing the registered passkey changes every key derived from it. Treat the passkey as the root of your derived identities.

In other words: tapkey is not a vault. It is a deterministic derivation tool built on top of passkey security.

## Requirements

- macOS 15.0 or later
- Apple Silicon (`arm64`)
- A passkey provider with PRF support

## Development

```bash
# Enter dev shell
nix develop

# Build and sign
make

# Build, sign, and install
make install

# Verify codesigning
make verify

# Clean
make clean
```

### Encrypting Secrets For CI

```bash
echo -n "secret-value" | age -R secrets/age-recipients.txt -o secrets/SECRET_NAME.age

AGE_SECRET_KEY=$(./distribution/get-age-key.sh)
echo "$AGE_SECRET_KEY" | age -d -i - secrets/SECRET_NAME.age
```
